        <h2 class="chaos">Description</h2>
        <p>A very light and fluffy pancake recipe that requires fresh buttermilk, 
            but it's the best I've ever made!</p>
        <p class="chaos">As convenient as a store-bought mix can be, 
            every home cook needs a good buttermilk pancake recipe in their repertoire. 
            Don't have a tried-and-true favorite yet? You're in luck!</p>
        <p>There's nothing like plain buttermilk pancakes topped with maple syrup. 
            But, if you're in the mood to add something extra to your breakfast, you can! 
            Optional mix-ins include chocolate chips, berries, and nuts. 
            You could also add cinnamon and vanilla to the batter for a little extra warmth. 
            Instead of syrup, you could top your buttermilk pancakes with 
            jam or honey for a sweet twist on a classic.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>3 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons white sugar</li>
            <li>3 teaspoons baking powder</li>
            <li class="quarter">1 ½ teaspoons baking soda</li>
            <li class="quarter">¾ teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>3 cups buttermilk</li>
            <li class="quarter">½ cup milk</li>
            <li class="chaos">3 eggs</li>
            <li class="quarter">⅓ cup butter, melted</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a large bowl. 
                Beat together buttermilk, milk, eggs, and melted butter in a separate bowl. 
                Keep the two mixtures separate until you are ready to cook.</li>
            <li class="chaos">Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium-high heat. 
                You can flick water across the surface and if it beads up and sizzles, 
                it's ready.</li>
            <li class="chaos">Pour the wet mixture into the dry mixture; use a wooden spoon or fork 
                to mix until it's just blended together. 
                The batter will be a little lumpy which is what you want.</li>
            <li>Pour or scoop the batter onto the preheated griddle, 
                using approximately 1/2 cup for each pancake. 
                Cook until bubbles appear on the surface, 1 to 2 minutes; 
                flip with a spatula and cook until browned on the other side. 
                Repeat with remaining batter.</li>
            <li>Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
